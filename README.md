#3D Visualization of Optical Lattice

  This software is developed for scientists who work on the realization of optical lattices. For convenience, the graphical user interface has been added to the software for users who does not have deep computer programming backgrounds.

### Installation

  Before using the software, it is required to install few open source Python packages. We will briefly describe how to install the packages based on OS, such as Ubuntu, Mac, and Windows.

#### 1. Scipy Stack

  Scipy stack is a collection of open souce packages for scientific computing in Python. In our software, Numpy and Matplotlib are the primary packages that used for the calculation and visulization of optical lattices.
  
##### Ubuntu

```
sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib ipython ipython-notebook python-pandas python-sympy python-nose
```

##### Mac

```
sudo port install py27-numpy py27-scipy py27-matplotlib py27-ipython +notebook py27-pandas py27-sympy py27-nose
```

##### Windows

For Windows users, the easiest way to install the packages of Scipy stack is to download one of these Python distributions, which includes all the key packages:

[Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
[Enthought Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/)
[Python(x,y)](http://python-xy.github.io/)
